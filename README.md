#SWB model
Java implementation for Modeling General and Specific Aspect of Documents with a Probabilistic Topic Model [1]. A special word with background (SWB) model is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. It allows words in documents to be modeled as either originating from general topics, or from document-specific "special" word distributions, or from a corpus-wide background distribution.
